## Installation
You can install the `fsrs` Java library from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.open-spaced-repetition/fsrs).

## Quickstart

```java
import io.github.openspacedrepetition.Scheduler;
import io.github.openspacedrepetition.Card;
import io.github.openspacedrepetition.Rating;
import io.github.openspacedrepetition.CardAndReviewLog;
import io.github.openspacedrepetition.ReviewLog;

import java.time.Instant;
import java.time.Duration;

public class SRS {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler.defaultScheduler();

        // note: all new cards are 'due' immediately upon creation
        Card card = new Card();

        // Choose a rating and review the card with the scheduler
        /*
        * Rating.AGAIN (==1) forgot the card
        * Rating.HARD (==2) remembered the card with serious difficulty
        * Rating.GOOD (==3) remembered the card after a hesitation
        * Rating.EASY (==4) remembered the card easily
        */
        Rating rating = Rating.GOOD;

        CardAndReviewLog result = scheduler.reviewCard(card, rating);
        card = result.card();
        ReviewLog reviewLog = result.reviewLog();

        System.out.println(
                "Card rated " + reviewLog.rating() + " at " + reviewLog.reviewDateTime());
        // > Card rated GOOD at 2025-07-10T04:16:19.637219Z

        // when the card is due next for review
        Instant due = card.getDue();

        // how much time between now and when the card is due
        Duration timeDelta = Duration.between(Instant.now(), due);

        System.out.println("Card due on: " + due);
        System.out.println("Card due in " + timeDelta.toSeconds() + " seconds");
        // > Card due on: 2025-07-10T04:26:19.637219Z
        // > Card due in 599 seconds

    }

}
```

## Versioning

This Java library is currently unstable and adheres to the following versioning scheme:

- `MINOR` version number will increase when a backward-incompatible change is introduced
- `PATCH` version number will increase when a bug is fixed, a new feature is added or when anything else warrants a new release

Once this package is considered stable, the `MAJOR` version number will be bumped to `1.0.0` and will then follow [semver](https://semver.org/).
